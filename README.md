In the modern era, women cannot so much as leave their house without being constantly aware of their surroundings for fear that they could be assaulted. Women go out in groups, live in groups, and even go to the bathroom in groups. Being in a group gives them a sense of security, but what about when they go out alone? With our    app, even going out alone,you are never alone. This will empower users to embrace their independence and empower them to live full and fulfilling  lives.
