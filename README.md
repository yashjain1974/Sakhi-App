# Inspiration:

In the modern era, women cannot so much as leave their house without being constantly aware of their surroundings for fear that they could be assaulted. Women go out in groups, live in groups, and even go to the bathroom in groups. Being in a group gives them a sense of security, but what about when they go out alone? With our    app, even going out alone,you are never alone. This will empower users to embrace their independence and empower them to live full and fulfilling  lives.

# Solution:

Our goal was to create a simple and creative Appliacation for users   to document their feelings, and relieve stress or anxiety. We wanted to create a platform to improve users mental health through a progressive timeline of a meditation and health issues and affirmations that empower users in difficult times


# What it does:-

# How we built it:-

We used Kivymd  which is a collection of Material Design compliant widgets for use  with Kivy, a framework for cross-platform, touch-enabled graphical applications     for the app design and implementation. Kivy is a free and open source Python framework for developing mobile apps and other multitouch application software with a   natural user interface.
The app is made for Android. It can also run on iOS, GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows
